Future automated unit tests to be implemented for the Low-Level Messaging APIs:

Test 4:
 - Create a thread that tries to become a client of a service that it later advertises itself.
 - Make sure the open call-back happens later.

Test 5:
 - Spawn separate processes for client and server.
 - Kill client and re-start it loads of times.
 - Check that server isn't leaking anything.

Test 6:
 - Spawn separate processes for client and server.
 - Kill server.
 - Check that client dies too.

Test 7:
 - Spawn separate processes for client and server.
 - Register close handler on client.
 - Kill server.
 - Check that client doesn't die too.
 - Re-spawn server.
 - Check that client can reconnect to service.
