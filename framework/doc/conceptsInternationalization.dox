/** @page conceptsInternationalization Internationalization

Legato provides string manipulation functions that support UTF-8 encoding.

Other internationalization and localization features are left up to app
developers.

@todo Do we need to provide locale-specific formatting tools (e.g., comma vs. period for decimals,
date format specification, etc.), or can we just leave that up to developers to sort out themselves?
