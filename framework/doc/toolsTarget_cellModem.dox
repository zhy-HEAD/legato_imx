/** @page toolsTarget_cm cm

Use the Cellular Modem tool to control modem functions.

@warning This tool has been designed to be used for development and testing purposes by a user in
real time.  This tool should not be called from user apps, and may cause instabilities if called
continuously.  @ref c_le_data should be used to open and configure connections within user apps.

<h1>Usage</h1>

<b><c> cm [SERVICES] [COMMANDS] </c></b>

@section toolsTarget_cm_adc ADC

@verbatim cm adc read channel @endverbatim
> Read and print the value from an adc channel (where @c channel is one of the names returned).

@section toolsTarget_cm_data Data

@verbatim cm data
cm data info @endverbatim
> Get info on profile in use.

@verbatim cm data profile <index> @endverbatim
> Set profile in use.

@verbatim cm data apn <apn> @endverbatim
> Set apn for profile in use.

@verbatim cm data pdp <pdp> @endverbatim
> Set pdp type for profile in use.

@verbatim cm data auth <none/pap/chap> <username> <password> @endverbatim
> Set authentication for profile in use.

@verbatim cm data connect <optional timeout (secs)> @endverbatim
> Start a data connection.

@verbatim cm data watch @endverbatim
> Monitor the data connection.

To start a data connection, ensure that your profile is configured correctly.
Also ensure your modem is registered to the network. To verify, use <c>cm radio</c> and check @c Status.

@todo With the evolution of DCS to handle several technologies (wifi, cellular, ...), <c> cm data </c>
should be modified: it uses DCS to create a cellular data connection, but DCS is not dedicated to
the cellular technology anymore.

If you specify a time-out timer when starting a data connection, it will try to start a data
connection until the timer expires.

When starting a data connection, currently it only uses profile 1. Any configuration set for other
profiles can't be used to start a data connection through the cm tool.
