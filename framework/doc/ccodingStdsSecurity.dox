The CERT C Coding Standard is a secure coding standard developed by a community of experts on the
[wiki.](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standard)  The CERT
C Coding Standard consists of over one hundred rules and an even larger set of recommendations.  The
most important distinction between a rule and a recommendation is:
-  A violation of a rule is likely to result in code that is less safe, reliable, and/or secure.
-  Application of a recommendation is likely to result in code that is safer, more reliable and/or
   more secure.

The CERT C Coding Standard does not attempt to impose coding style.  The current CERT C Coding
Standard was developed specifically for C11, however, the vast majority of the rules and
recommendations are applicable to older versions of C (ie. C99).

The most up-to-date set of CERT C Coding Standard rules (along with explanations, examples, etc) can
 be found here: [https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/2+Rules](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/2+Rules).

CERT has performed a useful risk assessment of each of the C Coding Standard rules.  Each rule is
assigned a priority based on three factors: the severity of the impact a violation of the rule can
lead to, the likelihood of the rule being violated and the remediation cost of correcting the
violation.  The following is a list of the CERT C Coding Standard rules ordered most severe to
least severe.  The list also includes the priority value of each rule but does not include the
likelihood or remediation cost as these are essentially captured by the priority level.  As stated
earlier the list is ordered by severity rather than priority because severity is deemed most
important in the context of security.

| Rule Number      | Description                                                  | Severity | Priority |

This coding standard adopts all of the CERT C Coding Standard rules, with the exception of rules
specific to Windows (rules with numbers WINxx-C).  Conformance to all of the CERT C Coding Standard
rules is necessary to conform to this coding standard.

@note Conformance to the CERT C Coding Standard recommendations is not strictly required at this time
but is highly recommended.  Requirement to conform to certain CERT C Coding Standard recommendations
may be added in the future.

@section codingSecFunctionBlackList Function Black List

Some C library functions are dangerous because they do not perform bounds checking or do not report
error conditions.  The following is a list of forbidden functions that must never be used.

| Forbidden Functions | Safer Alternatives       | Reason                                          |

@section codingSecComplilerWarnings Compiler Warnings

All compiler warnings must be resolved.  To enforce this the @c -Werror GCC option must be used.  In
addition the following GCC options should be used to prevent questionable coding practice:
@c -Werror, @c -Wall, @c -Wcast-align, @c -Wstrict-prototypes.
