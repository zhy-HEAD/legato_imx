/** @page sampleApps_fwupdateDownloader Firmware Update Downloader

The firmware update process can be invoked remotely by sending an update package on
the TCP port 5000.

For example by using netcat:
@verbatim
nc [-q 0] <target_ip> 5000 < <spkg_name.cwe>
@endverbatim

@note The default port is 5000 but it can be changed in the source code.

@note If the cwe file is not correct, a timeout of 900 seconds may occur when the firmware update
process is expecting incoming data.

@note If no data are sent by the host to the firmware update process during more than 900 seconds,
a timeout will occur and the download will fail.
