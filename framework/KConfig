config ENABLE_SEGV_HANDLER
  bool "Enable SIGSEGV handler"
  depends on LINUX
  default y
  ---help---
  When a segmentation fault occurs, use signal derivation and
  sigsetjmp()/siglongjmp() to try and survive the invalid memory access long
  enough to generate a backtrace.  This handler relies on undefined behaviour
  of sigsetjmp() and is therefore not guaranteed to work.

config ENABLE_BACKTRACE
  bool "Enable Legato assertion backtraces"
  default y
  ---help---
  Print backtraces when a Legato assertion is triggered.  This can be helpful
  in debugging errors.

config USE_GUARD_BAND
  bool "Enable memory guard bands"
  default y
  ---help---
  Insert chunks of memory into each allocated memory block before and after
  the user data portion.  These "guard bands" are filled with a special
  pattern that is unlikely to occur in normal data.  Whenever a block is
  allocated or released, the guard bands are checked for corruption and any
  corruption is reported.

  int "Number of guard band words"
  depends on USE_GUARD_BAND
  range 1 8
  default 1 if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default 8

   - Number of allocations
   - Maximum blocks used

config LOG_FUNCTION_NAMES
  bool "Log function names"
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Include the function name where a log message originated in the message preamble.

config THREAD_SETNAME
  bool "Set names of threads created from Legato"
  default y
  ---help---
  Use Legato thread names as the names for underlying OS threads as well.
  This has no effect if the OS does not allow setting thread names.  If Legato
  thread names are disabled, this will just set the name to "<legato>."

config NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in Legato objects"
  default y
  ---help---
  Add name fields to Legato objects (mutexes, threads, memory pools, etc)
  for logging, debugging, and tracing purposes.  Turning this off will
  reduce RAM usage at the expense of traceability.

config FD_MONITOR_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in file descriptor monitors"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato file descriptor monitors.

  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato memory pools.

config MEM_TRACE
  bool "Enable memory pool tracing"
  depends on MEM_POOL_NAMES_ENABLED
  default n
  ---help---
  If enabled, the memory subsystem will create a trace point for every memory
  pool created.  The name of the tracepoint will be the same of the pool, and
  is of the form "component.poolName".

config TIMER_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in timers"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato timers.

config EVENT_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in events"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED

  Add a name field to Legato event IDs.

config HASHMAP_NAMES_ENABLED
  bool "Enable names in hashmaps"
  depends on NAMES_ENABLED
  default n if REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato hashmaps.  Disabling this also disables
  hashmap tracing.

  default y
  ---help---
  Add a name field to Legato safe references.

config REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  bool "Reduce memory and storage use where possible"
  default n
  ---help---
  Try to reduce the memory and storage footprint of Legato.  This may use
  alternate data structures which are optimized for size and reduce the scale
  of some tests.  Selecting this option may result in lower performance and
  slower applications.

config STATIC_THREAD_STACKS
  bool "Statically allocate thread stacks"
  depends on RTOS
  default n
  ---help---
  Allocate stack space for Legato threads from static memory (bss) rather than
  from the heap.

config MEM_POOLS
  bool "Use memory pools"
  default y
  ---help---
  Use memory pools for dynamic memory allocation.  Memory pools help prevent
  memory fragmentation, but require that the pools be sized appropriately for
  the application.
  Disabling this option will still allocate memory using the memory pool
  interface (le_mem), but switches the internal behaviour to use malloc and
  free on a per-block basis.  This allows tools like Valgrind to accurately
  track the allocations and de-allocations at the cost of potential memory
  fragmentation.

  int "Maximum path iterator count"
  depends on MEM_POOLS
  range 0 65535
  default 10
  ---help---
  The maximum number of path iterator in the process-wide iterator pools, from
  which all Legato path iterators are allocated.

config MAX_MSG_LOCAL_CLIENT_SESSION_POOL_SIZE
